			<h1>"Nebulas"</h1>
			<h2>A free-spirited exploration of interactions with liquid and light at 1/400th of a second.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Utilizing high-speed flash photography, frequency separation, gradient painting, and image stacking, I present a collection of images
				that seeks to celebrate and question the definition of photography. I invite you to dive into the magnificent properties in which light gives shape to forms of art all around us.
