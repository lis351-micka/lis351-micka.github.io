			<h1>Making It</h1>
			<h2>A glance into the making of "Nebulas"</h2>
		</div>
		<dt>Methodology: <!-- Description List Header -->
			<dd><strong>1.</strong> Control of Lighting Environment (High-Speed Sync Flashes, High Shutter Speed, Dark Room).</dd> <!-- Description List Items -->
			<dd><strong>2.</strong> Backlighting for "Nebulas" to capture the depth of shape and color while minimizing reflections.</dd>
			<dd><strong>3.</strong> Top-Down Tripod Setup with Macro Lens for maximum resolution and detail, given the square image orientation desired and digital techniques to follow.</dd>
			<dd><strong>4.</strong> Utilize color channel, layered image stacking, luminance and image application tools to perform frequency separation and allow for explosive depths of color through additive, difference, multiplicative, and linear imaging tools. </dd>
			<dd><strong>5.</strong> Finalized works should bridge, and challenge, the gaps between several 'accepted' artforms to contrast with dismissive takes on digital forms: painting (watercolor, oil, acrylic), photography (analog), sculpture (dimensional shaping of form, manual and physical process).
