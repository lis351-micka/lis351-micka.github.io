				<img src="images/Self_Portrait.jpg" alt="A headshot image of the artist, Spencer Micka."> <!-- Accompanying Image for Step 1 -->
				<p>I'm passionate about creating artwork that challenges and questions our ideas on digital art, and the ideas that confine and limit it - specifically photography.</p>
				<p>My work blends and blurs the lines between many forms: digital photography, digital painting, photo manipulation, digital collage, and more.</p>
				<p>What is most exciting about my work isn't the artwork, but people's response to it. Some tell me they see legendary and mythical heroes, temples, and figures. Others say they see animals, creatures of the deep, or birds. Artwork and audiences are collaborators - and so I have named each piece in the spirit of the stories shared with me.</p>
				<p>Originally inspired by the symmetry of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">Rorschach Test inkblots</a>, I sought to continually expand on the concept of reflection - both visually and in the spirit of my work. The abstract imagery presents ample opportunities for representational interpretations; withnessing interactions between audiences, sharing their individual interpretations and forming collaborative ones, has been a rewarding and touching experience.</p>
